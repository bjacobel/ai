####README
------
This project contains code that implements the local search algorithm for the N-Queens problem.

The code is Python, and has been tested on version 2.7.3. To run the code, enter the command

	python nqueens.py -n <number-of-queens>

If you do not specify the *-n* command line switch for the number of queens, 8 queens will be used.
