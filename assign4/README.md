####README
------
This project contains code that implements the local search algorithm for the N-Queens problem.

The code is Python, and has been tested on version 2.7.3. It should run on Python 3, but I haven't tested it.

To run the code, enter the command

	python nqueens.py -n <number-of-queens>

If you do not specify the *-n* command line switch for the number of queens, 8 queens will be used.


The file test.py contains code to run the program multiple times and compile the results. To run it:

	python test.py

Variables such as number of iterations, number of queens and so forth are hard-coded in this file.
